### Build Guide
All STLs have been adjusted so that they should import into your slicer in their optimal orientation. 
I suggest printing these files in PLA with %30 infill and 4 walls to ensure that they are sturdy enough to beat on. Depending on your printer it may be worthwhile to enable brims to prevent warping and auto-generated tree supports to ensure clean overhangs. 

Prepare the drum halves by applying a light coat of quick cure epoxy resin (or super glue) to the indicated areas. Carefully slide the center body into position over both drum halves and secure them until the adhesive cures.

Now that the body is a single unit you can begin by carefully inserting brass inserts into the indicated holes using your soldering iron. Be careful to ensure that they are inserted flush and level. 

Solder an appropriate length of wire to the pins of the piezo modules and insert one into each recess at the bottom of each drum half with a mm M3 screw. Feed the wires through the opening into the main body of the drum. 

On the underside of each drum head insert the piezo disks into their matching recess with the wires oriented to guarantee connection to the modules inside the drum. Secure them using a bead of hot glue around the edge of the sensor.
